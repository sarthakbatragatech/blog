Howdy, I'm <span style="color:red">**Sarthak!**</span>

I do freelance work on projects that involve **data analytics** and **visualization**. I graduated as a computer engineer from Georgia Tech and over time, fell in love with being a **machine learning** and **deep learning practitoner**.

Sports, nature and culture are a few of my favorite things and in a quest to better understand them, I love to make use of the technical jargon mentioned above. This blog is an attempt to share such work and make it easy for others to reproduce and extend it.
